I found in signal(7) and by using these tests that SIGUSR2 is not guaranteed to queue.
In our case (in gvnsr) that means that if multiple SIGUSR2's are sent, the handler
may be invoked only once.  But, the SIGRTxxx signals do queue, receipt is guaranteed,
and order is guaranteed.  I need that in GVNSR
